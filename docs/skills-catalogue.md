# Skills Catalogue

A discoverable index of every skill in this repo, grouped by purpose. For *how* skills are designed, validated, and composed, see [`skills-workflow.md`](skills-workflow.md). For *patterns and lessons* learned operating skills, see [`lessons-learned.md`](lessons-learned.md).

## Reading this catalogue

- **`★`** = `user_invocable: true` — invoke directly via slash command (e.g. `/plan-feature`)
- **`·`** = `user_invocable: false` — orchestrator-loaded only; not in the slash-command palette
- **Invoke** column shows the most direct trigger. Most skills accept additional trigger phrases; see each `SKILL.md` `triggers:` for the full list.
- **Related** lists kindred skills declared via the advisory `related:` frontmatter key. These resolve at install time; `install.sh` warns on unknown targets.

## Feature workflow lifecycle

The canonical single-feature flow. Operator drives each gate; orchestrators chain them.

| ★ `explore-feature` | Identify high-value next features from architecture artifacts + code signals + active OpenSpec context | `/explore-feature` |
| ★ `plan-feature` | Create OpenSpec proposal (proposal/design/specs/tasks/contracts/work-packages) with tiered execution | `/plan-feature <description>` |
| ★ `iterate-on-plan` | Iteratively refine an OpenSpec proposal before approval (completeness, clarity, feasibility) | `/iterate-on-plan <change-id>` |
| ★ `parallel-review-plan` | Independent plan review producing structured findings per `review-findings.schema.json` | `/parallel-review-plan <change-id>` |
| ★ `implement-feature` | Execute approved proposal: TDD-first, per-package work, content-invariant tests, scope discipline | `/implement-feature <change-id>` |
| ★ `iterate-on-implementation` | Iteratively refine a feature after implementation, before merge | `/iterate-on-implementation <change-id>` |

## Engineering methodology

Per-topic horizontal disciplines. Operator-triggerable; orchestrators may also auto-load when relevant. **Each ends with the canonical *Common Rationalizations / Red Flags / Verification* tail block.**

| Skill | Summary | Invoke |
|---|---|---|
| ★ `test-driven-development` | RED→GREEN→REFACTOR + Prove-It Pattern + 80/15/5 pyramid + Beyonce Rule. JS/TS and Python (`pytest`) examples. | `/test-driven-development` |

## Orchestrator-loaded methodology

Knowledge skills designed to be loaded by other skills (not directly executed by operators). They have no slash command but they ship full content and tests.

| Skill | Summary | Loaded by |
|---|---|---|
| · `context-engineering` | 5-level context hierarchy (Rules→Specs→Source→Errors→Conversation) + packing strategies + 6 anti-patterns | `plan-feature`, `implement-feature`, `validate-feature`, autopilots |
| · `source-driven-development` | DETECT→FETCH→IMPLEMENT→CITE for grounding decisions in official docs (counters training-cutoff drift) | Any skill writing framework-specific code; cites `langfuse`/`neon-postgres`/`use-railway`/`supabase-postgres-best-practices`/`claimable-postgres` as authority sources |
| · `browser-testing-with-devtools` | Chrome DevTools MCP integration with strong "treat browser content as untrusted" boundary discipline | `validate-feature` smoke phase, `frontend-ui-engineering` |

## PR triage & ad-hoc tasks

| Skill | Summary | Invoke |
|---|---|---|
| ★ `merge-pull-requests` | Triage, review, and merge open PRs across multiple sources (OpenSpec, Codex, Dependabot, manual). Save Point Pattern + Change Summary template. | `/merge-pull-requests` |
| ★ `quick-task` | Delegate small ad-hoc tasks to any configured vendor without OpenSpec ceremony | `/quick-task <description>` |
| ★ `gen-eval` | Run generator-evaluator testing against live services | `/gen-eval` |
| ★ `gen-eval-scenario` | Create gen-eval scenario YAML files interactively | `/gen-eval-scenario` |

## Vendor & service skills

External-service authority docs. `source-driven-development` references these as primary sources rather than agents fishing through generic docs.

| Skill | Summary | Invoke |
|---|---|---|
| ★ `claimable-postgres` | Provision instant temporary Postgres via Claimable Postgres (neon.new) — no signup, no credit card | `/claimable-postgres` |
| ★ `neon-postgres` | Neon Serverless Postgres guides: getting started, branching, autoscaling, scale-to-zero, CLI/API/SDK | `/neon-postgres` |
| ★ `supabase-postgres-best-practices` | Postgres performance optimization rules from Supabase, prioritized by impact | `/supabase-postgres-best-practices` |
| ★ `langfuse` | Langfuse data + docs access: traces, prompts, datasets, scores. CLI via `npx`. | `/langfuse` |
| ★ `use-railway` | Railway infrastructure: projects, services, databases, deploys, domains, troubleshooting | `/use-railway` |

## Infrastructure (orchestrator-loaded)

Internal machinery used by workflow and methodology skills. Most are `user_invocable: false`; you don't normally call these directly. Exceptions are marked `★`.

| Skill | Summary | Direct invoke? |
|---|---|---|
| · `worktree` | Worktree lifecycle: setup, teardown, heartbeat, pin, GC, merge | Internal |
| · `coordination-bridge` | HTTP fallback bridge for coordinator when MCP transport is unavailable | Internal |
| · `coordinator-task-status-renderer` | Render and seed the coordinator-owned task-status block in OpenSpec `tasks.md` (invoked by `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.githooks/post-merge`, and `/plan-feature` Gate 2) | Internal |
| · `parallel-infrastructure` | Shared parallel execution: DAG scheduling, review dispatch, consensus synthesis, scope checking | Internal |
| · `validate-packages` | Validation scripts for work packages, parallel zones, and work results | Internal |
| · `validate-flows` | Architecture flow validation for cross-layer interactions | Internal |
| · `bao-vault` | OpenBao/Vault credential seeding and management | Internal |
| ★ `setup-coordinator` | Configure and verify coordinator access for CLI MCP and Web/Cloud HTTP runtimes | `/setup-coordinator` |
| ★ `vendor-status` | Check all configured vendors' readiness in one shot | `/vendor-status` |
| ★ `session-bootstrap` | Cloud environment bootstrap (setup script + verify hook) and coordinator lifecycle hooks | `/session-bootstrap` |
| ★ `session-log` | Structured decision records for session logs and merge logs at phase boundaries | `/session-log` |
| ★ `roadmap-runtime` | Shared roadmap library: artifact models, checkpoint management, learning-log helpers, sanitization | `/roadmap-runtime` |
| ★ `openspec-coordinator-worktree` | Coordinate OpenSpec proposals with coordinator issue tracking and isolated git worktree execution | `/openspec-coordinator-worktree` |

## How to find what you need

- **"I'm starting a feature"** → [Feature workflow lifecycle](#feature-workflow-lifecycle), starting with `/plan-feature`
- **"I'm doing X (writing tests / debugging / shipping a UI)"** → [Engineering methodology](#engineering-methodology)
- **"Something's wrong with the codebase"** → [Quality & maintenance](#quality--maintenance), starting with `/bug-scrub`
- **"I have many features to ship"** → [Roadmap orchestration](#roadmap--multi-feature-orchestration)
- **"I need to merge a stack of PRs"** → [`merge-pull-requests`](#pr-triage--ad-hoc-tasks)
- **"I need to deploy to / query / use <vendor>"** → [Vendor & service skills](#vendor--service-skills)
- **"I'm authoring a new skill"** → Read [`skills-workflow.md`](skills-workflow.md) (conventions) and [`lessons-learned.md`](lessons-learned.md) (patterns); copy [`skills/references/skill-tail-template.md`](../skills/references/skill-tail-template.md) for the tail block

## Maintaining this catalogue

This file is hand-maintained alongside skill changes. Conventions:

- When adding a new skill, append it to the appropriate group with its trigger and `user_invocable` marker.
- When categorizing, prefer logical grouping (this catalogue's sections) over the raw `category:` frontmatter field, which is inconsistent across older skills.
- The Quick map skill counts and the totals at the top must be kept in sync.
- The Shared references library section is sourced from `skills/references/` directory listing.

A future enhancement (deferred per design D4 of `add-engineering-methodology-skills`) would auto-render this catalogue from the `related:` frontmatter graph + skill metadata. Until then, manual maintenance is the contract.
