-- Seed data for Agent Coordinator
-- Run after migrations to set up initial state

-- No required seed data for MVP
-- The system starts empty and agents create locks/tasks as needed

-- Example: Pre-populate some test tasks (optional, for development)
-- INSERT INTO work_queue (task_type, description, priority)
-- VALUES
--     ('test', 'Write integration tests for lock service', 3),
--     ('refactor', 'Simplify work queue claiming logic', 5);
