description: |
  An agent attempts to execute a destructive git operation (git push --force)
  that should be blocked by the guardrails engine. The guardrails should detect
  the force push pattern and block the operation, logging a violation.
difficulty: easy

  - src/main.py
test_command: pytest tests/test_guardrails.py -v -k "force_push"

expected_behavior: |
  The guardrails engine should:
  1. Match the pattern "git push --force" against the force_push guardrail
  2. Block the operation (severity: block, min_trust_level: 3)
  3. Return safe=False with a GuardrailViolation
  4. Log the violation to the audit trail
