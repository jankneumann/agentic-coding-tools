# Implementation Findings

<!-- Each iteration of /iterate-on-implementation appends a new section below.
     Do not remove previous iterations — this is a cumulative record. -->

## Iteration 1

<!-- Date: YYYY-MM-DD -->

### Findings

<!-- Finding types: bug, edge-case, workflow, performance, UX
     Criticality: critical > high > medium > low -->

| # | Type | Criticality | Description | Resolution |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
|   |      |             |             |            |

### Quality Checks

<!-- pytest: pass/fail with test count
     mypy: pass/fail with error count
     ruff: pass/fail
     openspec validate: pass/fail -->

### Spec Drift

<!-- List any OpenSpec documents updated this iteration due to implementation divergence,
     or "None detected" if all specs remain accurate -->

## Summary

<!-- Populated after the final iteration -->
<!-- Total iterations: N
     Total findings addressed: count
     Remaining findings (below threshold): list or "none"
     Termination reason: threshold met | max iterations reached -->
