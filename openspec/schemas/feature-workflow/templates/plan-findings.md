# Plan Findings

<!-- Each iteration of /iterate-on-plan appends a new section below.
     Do not remove previous iterations — this is a cumulative record. -->

## Iteration 1

<!-- Date: YYYY-MM-DD -->

### Findings

<!-- Finding types: completeness, clarity, feasibility, scope, consistency, testability, parallelizability
     Criticality: critical > high > medium > low -->

| # | Type | Criticality | Description | Resolution |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
|   |      |             |             |            |

### Quality Checks

<!-- Results of openspec validate --strict -->

### Parallelizability Assessment

<!-- Independent tasks: N
     Sequential chains: M
     Max parallel width: W
     File overlap conflicts: list or "none" -->

---

## Summary

<!-- Populated after the final iteration -->
<!-- Total iterations: N
     Total findings addressed: count
     Remaining findings (below threshold): list or "none"
     Termination reason: threshold met | max iterations reached -->
