# skill-workflow Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-iterate-on-implementation-skill. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Iterative Refinement Skill
The system SHALL provide an `iterate-on-implementation` skill that performs structured iterative refinement of a feature implementation after `/implement-feature` completes and before `/cleanup-feature` runs.

The skill SHALL accept the following arguments:
- Change-id (required; or detected from current branch name `openspec/<change-id>`)
- Max iterations (optional; default: 5)
- Criticality threshold (optional; default: "medium"; values: "critical", "high", "medium", "low")

#### Scenario: Basic iterative refinement
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/iterate-on-implementation <change-id>`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL review the proposal, design, tasks, and current implementation code
- **AND** produce a structured improvement analysis for each iteration
- **AND** implement all findings at or above the criticality threshold
- **AND** commit the iteration's changes as a separate commit
- **AND** update documentation (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or docs/) with new lessons learned
- **AND** repeat until max iterations reached or only findings below threshold remain

#### Scenario: Early termination when only low-criticality findings remain
- **WHEN** an iteration's analysis produces only findings below the criticality threshold
- **THEN** the skill SHALL stop iterating and present a summary of all completed iterations
- **AND** report the remaining low-criticality findings for optional manual review

#### Scenario: Max iterations reached
- **WHEN** the configured max iterations have been completed
- **THEN** the skill SHALL stop iterating and present a summary
- **AND** report any remaining findings that were not addressed

#### Scenario: Out-of-scope findings
- **WHEN** an iteration identifies an issue that requires design changes beyond the current proposal scope
- **THEN** the skill SHALL flag the finding as "out of scope"
- **AND** recommend creating a new OpenSpec proposal for it
- **AND** NOT attempt to implement the out-of-scope change

#### Scenario: Parallel quality check execution
- **WHEN** the skill runs quality checks (pytest, mypy, ruff, openspec validate)
- **THEN** the skill SHALL execute all quality checks concurrently using Task(Bash) with run_in_background=true
- **AND** collect all results before reporting
- **AND** report all failures together rather than fail-fast on first error

#### Scenario: Quality check partial failure
- **WHEN** one or more quality checks fail while others succeed
- **THEN** the skill SHALL report all check results (both passing and failing)
- **AND** indicate which specific checks failed
- **AND** continue with iteration if fixes are possible

### Requirement: Structured Improvement Analysis
Each iteration SHALL produce a structured analysis where every finding contains:
- **Type**: One of bug, edge-case, workflow, performance, UX
- **Criticality**: One of critical, high, medium, low
- **Description**: What the issue is and why it matters
- **Proposed fix**: How to address the finding

#### Scenario: Analysis covers all improvement categories
- **WHEN** the skill reviews the current implementation
- **THEN** it SHALL evaluate for bugs, unhandled edge cases, workflow improvements, performance issues, and UX issues (where applicable)
- **AND** classify each finding by type and criticality

#### Scenario: Analysis is reproducible and auditable
- **WHEN** an iteration completes
- **THEN** the findings and actions taken SHALL be recorded in the commit message for that iteration

### Requirement: Iteration Commit Convention
Each iteration SHALL produce exactly one commit on the current feature branch with a message following this format:
```
refine(<scope>): iteration <N> - <summary>

Iterate-on-implementation: <change-id>, iteration <N>/<max>

Findings addressed:
- [<criticality>] <type>: <description>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

#### Scenario: Commit per iteration
- **WHEN** an iteration implements improvements
- **THEN** all changes for that iteration SHALL be staged and committed as a single commit
- **AND** the commit message SHALL list the findings addressed with their criticality and type

### Requirement: Documentation Update Per Iteration
Each iteration SHALL review whether genuinely new patterns, lessons, or gotchas were discovered and, if so, update the relevant documentation files.

Documentation updates SHALL follow the existing convention:
- Update CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md directly if they are under 300 lines each
- If either file exceeds 300 lines, refactor into focused documents in docs/ and reference them

#### Scenario: New lesson discovered during iteration
- **WHEN** an iteration reveals a pattern or gotcha not already documented
- **THEN** the skill SHALL add the lesson to CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or the appropriate docs/ file
- **AND** include the documentation change in the iteration's commit

#### Scenario: No new lessons in an iteration
- **WHEN** an iteration's findings are variations of already-documented patterns
- **THEN** the skill SHALL NOT add redundant documentation

### Requirement: OpenSpec Document Update Per Iteration
Each iteration SHALL review whether the current OpenSpec documents (proposal.md, design.md, spec deltas) accurately reflect the refined implementation. When findings reveal spec drift, incorrect assumptions, or missing requirements, the relevant OpenSpec documents SHALL be updated.

#### Scenario: OpenSpec document update on spec drift
- **WHEN** an iteration reveals that the proposal, design, or spec deltas contain assumptions or requirements that don't match the refined implementation
- **THEN** the skill SHALL update the relevant OpenSpec documents to reflect the actual state
- **AND** include those changes in the iteration's commit

#### Scenario: OpenSpec documents still accurate
- **WHEN** an iteration's changes are consistent with the existing OpenSpec documents
- **THEN** the skill SHALL NOT make unnecessary changes to OpenSpec documents

### Requirement: Skill Workflow Position

The `iterate-on-implementation` skill SHALL fit into the feature development workflow as an optional step between `/implement-feature` and `/cleanup-feature`. The `validate-feature` skill SHALL fit as an optional step between `/iterate-on-implementation` and `/cleanup-feature`:

```
/plan-feature → /implement-feature → /iterate-on-implementation (optional) → /validate-feature (optional) → /cleanup-feature
```

#### Scenario: Workflow integration
- **WHEN** the user completes `/implement-feature` and has a PR ready for review
- **THEN** they MAY invoke `/iterate-on-implementation` to refine the implementation before requesting review
- **AND** they MAY invoke `/validate-feature` to verify the deployed feature works correctly
- **AND** the skills SHALL operate on the existing feature branch without creating new branches

#### Scenario: Validate after iterate
- **WHEN** the user completes `/iterate-on-implementation`
- **THEN** they MAY invoke `/validate-feature` to verify the refined implementation against live deployment
- **AND** if validation fails, they MAY return to `/iterate-on-implementation` to address findings

#### Scenario: Validate without iterate
- **WHEN** the user completes `/implement-feature` without running `/iterate-on-implementation`
- **THEN** they MAY invoke `/validate-feature` directly
- **AND** the validation skill SHALL work regardless of whether iterate was run

### Requirement: Parallel Task Implementation Pattern
The `implement-feature` and `iterate-on-implementation` skills SHALL support parallel Task() subagents for implementing independent tasks or fixes concurrently.

#### Scenario: Spawn parallel implementation agents
- **WHEN** the skill identifies independent tasks (no shared files) that can be parallelized
- **THEN** it MAY spawn Task(general-purpose) agents with run_in_background=true
- **AND** scope each agent's prompt to specific files/modules
- **AND** NOT create git worktrees for agent isolation

#### Scenario: Agent file scope enforcement
- **WHEN** multiple agents are spawned for parallel implementation
- **THEN** each agent's prompt SHALL explicitly list which files/modules are in scope
- **AND** tasks with overlapping file scope SHALL be executed sequentially, not in parallel

#### Scenario: Result collection and integration
- **WHEN** all parallel agents complete their tasks
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL collect results using TaskOutput
- **AND** verify each agent's work before committing
- **AND** create a single commit integrating all agent work (or separate commits if appropriate)

#### Scenario: Agent failure recovery
- **WHEN** a background agent fails during execution
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL report the failure with context
- **AND** MAY attempt recovery using the Task resume parameter
- **AND** SHALL NOT commit partial work from failed agents without user confirmation

### Requirement: Parallel Context Exploration Pattern
Skills that gather context (plan-feature, iterate-on-plan) SHALL support parallel Task(Explore) agents for faster context collection when multiple independent sources need analysis.

#### Scenario: Parallel exploration execution
- **WHEN** a skill needs to gather context from multiple sources (specs, code, in-progress changes)
- **THEN** it MAY spawn multiple Task(Explore) agents concurrently
- **AND** synthesize the results after all agents complete

#### Scenario: Exploration is read-only
- **WHEN** Task(Explore) agents are used for context gathering
- **THEN** they SHALL NOT modify any files
- **AND** they SHALL return analysis results to the orchestrator for synthesis

### Requirement: Worktree Isolation Pattern

The `implement-feature`, `iterate-on-implementation`, and `cleanup-feature` skills SHALL support per-feature git worktree isolation to enable concurrent CLI sessions working on different features.

Worktrees SHALL be created at `../<repo-name>.worktrees/<change-id>/` relative to the main repository.

#### Scenario: Worktree creation on implement-feature
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/implement-feature <change-id>`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL create a worktree at `../<repo-name>.worktrees/<change-id>/`
- **AND** create the feature branch `openspec/<change-id>` if it doesn't exist
- **AND** change the working directory to the worktree
- **AND** continue implementation in the worktree

#### Scenario: Skip worktree creation when already in worktree
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/implement-feature <change-id>`
- **AND** the current working directory is already the worktree for that change-id
- **THEN** the skill SHALL skip worktree creation
- **AND** continue with implementation

#### Scenario: Worktree detection in iterate-on-implementation
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/iterate-on-implementation <change-id>`
- **AND** the current working directory is a git worktree
- **THEN** the skill SHALL detect the main repository path
- **AND** resolve OpenSpec files from the main repository
- **AND** operate normally on implementation files in the worktree

#### Scenario: Worktree cleanup on cleanup-feature
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/cleanup-feature <change-id>`
- **AND** a worktree exists for that change-id
- **THEN** the skill SHALL remove the worktree after archiving
- **AND** NOT remove the worktree if cleanup is aborted

### Requirement: OpenSpec File Access in Worktrees

Skills running in worktrees SHALL access OpenSpec files from the main repository, not from the worktree.

#### Scenario: OpenSpec path resolution in worktree
- **WHEN** a skill needs to read OpenSpec files (proposal.md, tasks.md, design.md, specs/)
- **AND** the skill is running in a worktree
- **THEN** it SHALL resolve the path relative to the main repository using git-common-dir
- **AND** NOT expect OpenSpec files to exist in the worktree

### Requirement: Feature Validation Skill

The system SHALL provide a `validate-feature` skill that deploys the feature locally, runs behavioral tests against the live system, checks CI/CD status, and verifies OpenSpec spec compliance. The skill operates between `/iterate-on-implementation` and `/cleanup-feature` in the workflow.

The skill SHALL accept the following arguments:
- Change-id (required; or detected from current branch name `openspec/<change-id>`)
- `--skip-e2e` (optional; skip Playwright E2E phase)
- `--skip-playwright` (optional; alias for `--skip-e2e`)
- `--skip-ci` (optional; skip CI/CD status check)

- **AND** persist the report to `openspec/changes/<change-id>/validation-report.md`
- **AND** post the report as a PR comment via `gh pr comment` if a PR exists
- **AND** teardown deployed services after validation completes

#### Scenario: Selective phase execution
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/validate-feature <change-id> --phase smoke,e2e`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL run only the specified phases (Smoke and E2E in this example)
- **AND** skip Deploy if not included (assumes services are already running)
- **AND** skip Teardown if Deploy was not run
- **AND** still produce a validation report covering only the executed phases

#### Scenario: Deploy phase starts services with DEBUG logging
- **WHEN** the Deploy phase begins
- **THEN** the skill SHALL start services via docker-compose with `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` environment variable
- **AND** redirect service stdout/stderr to a log file for later analysis
- **AND** wait for health checks to confirm all services are ready
- **AND** fail fast with a clear message if Docker is not available

#### Scenario: Smoke phase verifies basic service health

- **AND** verify the MCP server responds to a basic tool call (if applicable)
- **AND** verify database migrations have been applied
- **AND** report which health checks passed or failed

#### Scenario: E2E phase runs Playwright tests
- **WHEN** the E2E phase begins and pytest-playwright is installed
- **THEN** the skill SHALL run Playwright E2E tests from the `tests/e2e/` directory
- **AND** report test results with failure details

#### Scenario: E2E phase skipped gracefully
- **WHEN** the E2E phase begins and either pytest-playwright is not installed, no `tests/e2e/` directory exists, or `--skip-e2e` flag was provided
- **THEN** the skill SHALL skip the E2E phase with an informational message
- **AND** NOT treat the skip as a failure

#### Scenario: Spec compliance phase verifies OpenSpec scenarios
- **WHEN** the Spec Compliance phase begins
- **THEN** the skill SHALL read all OpenSpec spec deltas for the change-id
- **AND** for each scenario, verify the expected behavior against the live system (via API calls, MCP tool invocations, or database queries)
- **AND** report pass/fail per scenario with details on mismatches

#### Scenario: Log analysis phase scans for warning signs
- **WHEN** the Log Analysis phase begins
- **THEN** the skill SHALL scan the collected log file for WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL entries
- **AND** flag deprecation notices, unhandled exceptions, and stack traces
- **AND** categorize findings by severity
- **AND** report findings with line numbers and context

#### Scenario: CI/CD status check
- **WHEN** the CI/CD Status phase begins and a GitHub remote is configured
- **THEN** the skill SHALL check CI/CD pipeline status via `gh run list` or `gh pr checks`
- **AND** report which checks passed, failed, or are still running
- **AND** skip gracefully with an informational message if no CI/CD workflow exists

#### Scenario: Critical phase failure stops validation
- **WHEN** the Deploy or Smoke phase fails
- **THEN** the skill SHALL stop validation immediately
- **AND** report the failure with diagnostic details
- **AND** still attempt teardown of any started services

#### Scenario: Non-critical phase failure continues validation
- **WHEN** the E2E, Spec Compliance, or Log Analysis phase fails
- **THEN** the skill SHALL continue with remaining phases
- **AND** include all failures in the final validation report

#### Scenario: Teardown cleans up resources
- **WHEN** validation completes (whether all phases passed or not)
- **THEN** the skill SHALL stop all docker-compose services started during the Deploy phase
- **AND** preserve the log file for manual inspection if failures occurred
- **AND** remove the log file if all phases passed

### Requirement: Validation Report Persistence and PR Integration

The validation skill SHALL persist results and integrate with the PR workflow.

#### Scenario: Report persisted to change directory
- **WHEN** validation completes
- **THEN** the skill SHALL write the validation report to `openspec/changes/<change-id>/validation-report.md`
- **AND** overwrite any previous report (only the latest run matters)
- **AND** include a timestamp and the git commit SHA at the top of the report

#### Scenario: Report posted as PR comment
- **WHEN** validation completes and a PR exists for the `openspec/<change-id>` branch
- **THEN** the skill SHALL post the validation report as a comment on the PR via `gh pr comment`
- **AND** prefix the comment with a header identifying it as an automated validation report

#### Scenario: No PR exists
- **WHEN** validation completes and no PR exists for the feature branch
- **THEN** the skill SHALL skip the PR comment step with an informational message
- **AND** still persist the report to the file

### Requirement: Validation Report Format

The validation skill SHALL produce a structured validation report at the end of each run that summarizes all phase results.

#### Scenario: All phases pass
- **WHEN** all validation phases pass
- **THEN** the report SHALL show a summary like:
  ```
  Validation Report: <change-id>
  ✓ Deploy: Services started (3 containers, DEBUG logging enabled)
  ✓ Smoke: All health checks passed (API, MCP, database)
  ✓ E2E: 5/5 Playwright tests passed
  ✓ Spec Compliance: 8/8 scenarios verified
  ✓ Log Analysis: No warnings or errors found
  ✓ CI/CD: All checks passing

  Result: PASS — Ready for /cleanup-feature
  ```

#### Scenario: Mixed results
- **WHEN** some phases fail while others pass
- **THEN** the report SHALL show each phase result with failure details:
  ```
  Validation Report: <change-id>
  ✓ Deploy: Services started
  ✓ Smoke: All health checks passed
  ✗ E2E: 3/5 tests passed, 2 failures
    - test_login_flow: TimeoutError on /api/auth
    - test_dashboard_load: Element not found: #stats-panel
  ✗ Spec Compliance: 6/8 scenarios verified, 2 mismatches

  ⚠ Log Analysis: 3 warnings found
    - [WARNING] Deprecated function call: old_api_handler (line 142)
  ✓ CI/CD: All checks passing

  Result: FAIL — Address findings, then re-run /validate-feature or proceed to /iterate-on-implementation
  ```

### Requirement: Validation Prerequisite Checks

The validation skill SHALL verify prerequisites before starting the validation phases.

#### Scenario: Docker not available
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/validate-feature` and Docker/docker-compose is not installed or not running
- **THEN** the skill SHALL fail immediately with a message explaining how to install/start Docker

#### Scenario: No docker-compose.yml found
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/validate-feature` and no docker-compose.yml exists in the project
- **THEN** the skill SHALL skip the Deploy phase and attempt Smoke tests against already-running services
- **AND** inform the user that deployment validation was skipped

#### Scenario: Feature branch verification
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/validate-feature`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL verify the current branch is `openspec/<change-id>`
- **AND** verify implementation commits exist on the branch
- **AND** fail with guidance if no implementation is found

### Requirement: Proposal Prioritization Skill
The system SHALL provide a `prioritize-proposals` skill that evaluates all active OpenSpec change proposals and produces a prioritized “what to do next” order for the agentic development pipeline.

The skill SHALL accept the following arguments:
- `--change-id <id>[,<id>]` (optional; limit analysis to specific change IDs)
- `--since <git-ref>` (optional; default: `HEAD~50`; analyze commits since ref for relevance)
- `--format <md|json>` (optional; default: `md`)

#### Scenario: Prioritized report generation
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/prioritize-proposals`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL analyze all active proposals under `openspec/changes/`
- **AND** produce an ordered list of proposals with a rationale for the ranking
- **AND** identify candidate next steps for the top-ranked proposal

#### Scenario: Scoped change-id analysis
- **WHEN** the user invokes `/prioritize-proposals --change-id add-foo,update-bar`
- **THEN** the skill SHALL limit analysis to the specified change IDs
- **AND** still provide relevance, refinement, and conflict assessments for each

### Requirement: Proposal Relevance and Refinement Analysis
The `prioritize-proposals` skill SHALL evaluate each proposal against recent commits and code changes to determine relevance, required refinements, and potential conflicts.

#### Scenario: Proposal already addressed by recent commits
- **WHEN** recent commits touch the same files and requirements as a proposal
- **THEN** the skill SHALL mark the proposal as likely addressed or needing verification
- **AND** recommend whether to archive, update, or re-scope the proposal

#### Scenario: Proposal needs refinement due to code drift
- **WHEN** a proposal’s target files or assumptions have changed since it was authored
- **THEN** the skill SHALL flag it as requiring refinement
- **AND** suggest which proposal documents to update (proposal.md, tasks.md, or spec deltas)

### Requirement: Conflict-Aware Prioritization Output
The `prioritize-proposals` skill SHALL rank proposals by factoring in estimated file conflicts and dependency ordering to minimize collisions for parallel agent work.

#### Scenario: Conflict-aware ordering
- **WHEN** two proposals modify overlapping files or specs
- **THEN** the skill SHALL order them to minimize merge conflicts
- **AND** explain the detected overlap in the report

#### Scenario: Conflict-free parallel suggestions
- **WHEN** proposals are independent and touch distinct files
- **THEN** the skill SHALL identify them as parallelizable workstreams
- **AND** include that suggestion in the output report

### Requirement: Prioritization Report Persistence
The skill SHALL write the prioritization report to `openspec/changes/prioritized-proposals.md` and update it on each run.

#### Scenario: Report saved for pipeline consumption
- **WHEN** the skill finishes its analysis
