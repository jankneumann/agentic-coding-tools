## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Define the `/test-e2e` skill workflow and triggering criteria.
- [ ] 1.2 Document local Docker deployment requirements (Postgres, Neo4j, Opik, frontend, backend) and DEBUG-enabled dev profile.
- [ ] 1.3 Specify CLI verification steps and Playwright E2E execution sequence.
- [ ] 1.4 Specify production deployment verification steps (Railway) including `/health` and feature-relevant endpoints.
- [ ] 1.5 Clarify which steps belong in GitHub Actions vs local execution.
- [ ] 1.6 Define artifact/log capture strategy (Playwright traces, screenshots, service logs) and storage location.
- [ ] 1.7 Add references/scripts needed by the skill (if any).
