## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Inventory active OpenSpec proposals and metadata (proposal.md, tasks.md, deltas)
- [x] 1.2 Analyze recent commits and file changes to detect obsolete or overlapping proposals
- [x] 1.3 Build prioritization logic that scores relevance, dependencies, and file conflicts
- [x] 1.4 Generate a prioritized "what to do next" report suitable for the agentic pipeline
- [x] 1.5 Add tests/fixtures for proposal analysis and conflict detection (N/A: pure skill with no executable code; analysis is performed by the AI agent following SKILL.md instructions)
- [x] 1.6 Document the new skill usage in skills guidance
